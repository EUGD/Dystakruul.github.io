Click on any cell/Character in the sheet and the Offset will automatically be adjusted so that the top left corner of the selected Sudoku will be where you clicked

### Arrow Keys

Use the Arrow Keys to shift the current sudoku position and to change the X/Y-Offset

### +/-

Use the "+" and "-" Keys to select a Sudoku with a higher or lower ID Number
(the keys on the Numpad work too!)

### WASD

### "Remember this Location"-Button
Click the "Remember this location" button to save the current sudoku location.
All saved/remembered Sudoku locations will be displayed from now on.

### Enter/Return-Key

## Removing Remembered Sudoku Positions

### "Remove last Remembered"-Button
Click this button to remove the most recently added location.

### Backspace/Del-Keys
Use these Keys as an alternative to the "Remove last Remembered"-Button. They also remove the most recently added sudoku location.

### "Clear all Remembered"-Button
This button clears the entire list of saved Sudoku positions. Be careful!

## Loading the Finished/Solved Sheet

Use the "Load solved Sheet"-Button to load the solution to the puzzle.
Keep in mind that this also removes all previously saved locations!

## Changing the Colors

Click the "Open Color Options"-Button to show color picking options for all the types of cells in the sheet.

### Active/Inactive Cells

'Active' or 'Inactive' refers to the Sudoku having either a number or an empty cell at that position.

### 'Neutral'

Neutral Cells are simply all the other cells that are currently neither active nor inactive
